# The app feedback loop, a build spec

A stack-agnostic specification for an **AI-native in-app feedback and bug-reporting loop**: a widget that captures a report with rich machine context, an admin inbox to triage it, a handoff that loads that full context into a coding agent, and a close-the-loop step that resolves the report and notifies the reporter, bound to the fix commit itself.

This is a spec, not code, so a coding agent can build it in whatever stack you use (SvelteKit, Next/React, Remix, Rails, anything). It assumes **Postgres + Supabase** as the default and calls out what is Supabase-specific with a generic equivalent each time. It pairs directly with the bundled [`fix-bug`](./skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md) skill, which is the agent side of the loop, and with [`VERIFY.md`](./VERIFY.md), the checklist the implementing agent runs when it believes it is done.

This spec is distilled from production implementations at [LawGrader / WriteGrader](./examples/grader/README.md) and, in an adapted form, the Eight Faces voice-coaching app (see [docs/adaptations.md](./docs/adaptations.md)). Where a rule exists because something broke in production, the spec says so.

## Conventions used below

The spec names concrete tools so examples stay runnable. Substitute freely; the loop does not care.

| Token used below | Meaning | Substitute with |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm <script>` | your package runner | `npm run`, `yarn`, `bun run`, `make` |
| `psql` | a direct SQL client | any DB client your agent can run |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | server env var names | whatever your project uses; keep them out of the client bundle |
| `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` | the deployed-commit env var | your platform's equivalent (`RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, a build arg, etc.) |
| `/api/feedback/report`, `/admin/bugs`, `/feedback` | route names | any routes; keep the three roles (intake, admin inbox, reporter page) distinct |

## Why this loop is worth building

Most feedback systems capture a sentence and lose everything around it. By the time someone looks, the context is gone: what screen, what the user clicked, what errored, what the network did. So reports are vague, repro is guesswork, and the loop never closes back to the person who reported it.

This design inverts that. It is built for a world where a **coding agent does the fix**, so the highest-leverage thing the system can do is **capture enough context that an agent can reproduce and fix the issue without a back-and-forth**, then **close the loop automatically** so reporting feels worth it. Concretely:

- **Capture is rich and passive.** One click grabs the route, a screenshot, the recent click/nav trail, the console and network rings, thrown errors, and the environment, all scrubbed of secrets before they leave the browser.
- **The handoff is one command.** From the inbox, "Open in Claude Code" copies `/fix-bug <id>`. The agent pulls the row, reconstructs the report, downloads the screenshot, and starts with the same context the user had.
- **The loop closes itself.** The fix commit carries a `Bug-Note:` trailer; a git hook resolves the report and notifies the reporter with that note. Fixing and closing are one action, so nothing rots in an inbox.

The result is a feedback channel where reporting is cheap, fixing is well-informed, and the reporter actually hears back.

## Findings come from humans or agents (the `source` tag)

The loop above is drawn with a human reporter, but the same pipeline is the
landing zone for **agent-generated** findings too. The `source` column on
`bug_reports` (`'user'` by default, in the DDL below) lets your QA agents file
through the identical intake, tagged: a route crawler files
`source: route-crawl`, a UX-critic agent files `source: ux-critic`, a
structured walkthrough files `source: walkthrough`. They ride the same capture
bundle, land in the same inbox, and hand off to `fix-bug` the same way, so you
have **one inbox, one triage, one close path** whether the reporter was a
person, a fuzzer, or the critic, and the inbox can filter "real reports only"
vs "self-audit" by `source`. (The full agent-reporter harness lives in the
[agent-team-kit](https://github.com/sdmurff/agent-team-kit); this repo carries
only the hooks it files into.)

The cheapest agent front door, from the LawGrader implementation: install a
dev-only global so a browsing agent can file without touching the UI:

```js
// installed only when import.meta.env.DEV (or equivalent)
window.__uxCritic = {
  submit({ kind, expectation, run, title, severity,
           code_pointer, suggested_fix, region }) { /* same POST, source: "ux-critic",
           extras parked under context.critic */ }
}
```

Two wrinkles when the reporter is an agent:
- Agent findings usually come from a disposable or local environment, not
  prod, so close them there with a thin `bug:resolve` wrapper rather than the
  prod-targeted `post-commit` hook. Real user bugs still close the normal
  commit-bound way.
- The "reporter" is a synthetic account, so the close-the-loop **notification is
  noise**, suppress it when `source` is an agent tag.

### The inbox is one store, but two queues

`source` is not just a tag, it is a **queue divider**. A human's report is a
customer signal; an agent's finding is your own QA output, filed in batches.
Mixing them buries the former and distorts every "how much feedback did we get"
count. So the same table gets a queue filter in the admin inbox, *from people*
/ *from our passes* / *all*, defaulting to people, driven entirely by `source`.
One store, one triage, one close path, two audiences kept apart.

### The structured QA pass as a first-class source

The richest agent source is a structured walk/sweep harness (specified in the
[agent-team-kit](https://github.com/sdmurff/agent-team-kit) as walks-and-sweeps),
and it is worth calling out because it exercises this schema the way it
was designed to be used. A walk/sweep finding files with `source: 'walkthrough'`
and carries the **same context bundle a widget report does**, assembled from the
run instead of the browser: the screenshot of the exact step or control
(uploaded to the identical `{id}/screenshot.png` path, so nothing downstream
special-cases it), the reviewer's expected/observed/why, the route, the
console-error and failed-request rings captured at that moment (landing in the
same `context.console` array `fix-bug` reads), a code pointer, a suggested fix,
and the command that reproduces it. Severity rides along, because it was judged
against a screenshot during review rather than left for triage to guess.

Two properties make it more than "another way to insert a row":

- **Idempotent filing.** Each finding has a stable id and is fingerprinted as
  `hash(passId :: findingId)`; the filer skips fingerprints already open, so
  re-running a pass never duplicates a ticket.
- **The report joins the inbox back.** The QA report is regenerated with a live
  lookup of filed findings by fingerprint, so each finding shows a copyable
  `/fix-bug <id>` and its ticket status inline, so reading the report and acting on
  it are one motion. A resolved ticket reads "fixed, re-run to verify" rather
  than disappearing, and the same `post-commit` close that resolves the bug also
  rebuilds the report, so it never goes stale on a fix.

This is the loop's ideal: the widget and the QA harness are two front doors to
the **same** capture-store-fix-close spine, and the harness proves the spine is
general enough to serve a machine reporter as cleanly as a human one.

## Part A, The widget (client)

### Mounting and positioning

- **Global.** Mount once in the root layout so it is present on every page.
- **Fixed bottom-right corner**, inset ~20px from the true viewport edge. (Note: if your app toggles a scrollbar gutter, pin to the true edge and compensate, or the tab will jump.) High stacking order (e.g. `z-index: 50`) so it floats above app content.
- **A docked launcher tab** is the resting state (pair it with a Help tab if you have one; keep them locked to the same edge).
- **Keyboard shortcut:** a 3-key chord (e.g. `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F`) opens it from anywhere. Avoid 2-key chords (collisions).
- **Programmatic open:** expose an event (e.g. dispatch a custom `open-feedback` event) so other surfaces (a "report a problem" link, a reporter's feedback page) can open it.
- **Screenshot warm-up:** on the launcher button's `pointerdown`, fire a "prime" event that begins loading the screenshot library and capturing, before the panel even renders. Capture feels instant this way.

### The panel

Four states: `launcher` (docked tab), `panel` (the form), `annotate` (full-screen screenshot editor, optional), `sent` (success toast, auto-dismiss ~4s).

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| screenshot preview | image | Auto-captured. Optional "Include this screenshot" checkbox, default **on**. Click to zoom / annotate (optional). |
| description | textarea | Max 2000 chars. Placeholder "Tell us anything." Show a remaining-chars counter under ~200 left. Optional voice-to-text button. Stored as `expectation`. |
| kind | single-select buttons | `bug` \| `confusing` \| `idea`. Default unset, sent as `bug`. (This is the only "category" axis; keep it to three.) |
| Send | button | Snapshots values, submits, optimistically shows success, resets, auto-collapses. |

**Panel width** ~380px, capped to viewport minus a margin. Form is keyboard-accessible; Escape collapses to launcher.

### Context capture (passive, on open/send)

Assemble a context bundle on the client (see Part C for the exact shape). It includes: the URL/route and title, viewport and device pixel ratio, color scheme, timezone and locale, scroll position, the last interacted element (a stable selector + its visible text), a small performance snapshot, and four **ring buffers** (most-recent-N, cap ~25 each): breadcrumbs (nav/click/input trail), console lines, network requests, and thrown errors.

Implement the rings as lightweight global instrumentation installed at app boot: patch `console.*`, wrap `fetch`/XHR, listen for `window.onerror`/`unhandledrejection`, and record route changes and clicks. Each ring keeps only the last ~25 entries so the payload stays small.

### PII scrubbing (do this client-side, before anything is sent)

Run every captured string (breadcrumb detail, console text, network URL, error message and stack) through a scrubber that redacts secrets:

- **JWTs:** `eyJ...[.]...[.]...` (three base64url segments) → `[redacted-jwt]`
- **Long opaque tokens:** any `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{40,}` run → `[redacted]`
- **Secret query params:** `?token=`, `&apikey=`, `&access_token=`, etc. → value `[redacted]`
- **Sensitive keys** matching `/(authorization|api[-_]?key|token|secret|password|bearer|cookie|session)/i` → `[redacted]`

Truncate per field (breadcrumb detail ~160, console ~300, network URL ~300, error message ~300, stack ~2000, first ~6 frames). The system never deliberately collects names, emails, or user data; scrubbing is the passive guard against secrets leaking through URLs/logs. (Screenshots can still contain on-screen PII; keep the bucket private, below.)

### Screenshot capture

- Use a DOM-to-PNG library (e.g. `modern-screenshot`, or `html2canvas`); native where available. Dynamic-import it so it's off the critical path; warm it on launcher `pointerdown`.
- Capture `document.body` at scale 1, with a solid background color, after `document.fonts.ready`, **excluding** the widget itself and anything marked `data-feedback-ignore`.
- Failure returns null and never blocks send. Guard the base64 payload (drop if > ~4MB client-side; the server enforces a hard cap too).
- Send as a `data:image/png;base64,...` string in the bundle.

Two traps found in production (LawGrader):
- **Capture at `scale: 1`, not a fractional downscale.** Fractional scaling reflowed borderline table rows in the capture, so the screenshot showed a layout the user never saw.
- **Textarea values capture blank** with DOM-clone libraries: they mirror form state via `setAttribute("value")`, which `<textarea>` ignores. Hook the clone step (e.g. `onCloneEachNode`) and copy the value into `textContent`, and unit-test it.

### The annotator (optional but recommended)

The `annotate` state is a full-screen canvas over the captured PNG with a small toolbar: **box, arrow, pen, text, and a redact tool** (solid blackout rectangles). Redact matters most: it is user-driven scrubbing for the one capture channel the automatic scrubber cannot reach, on-screen PII in the screenshot itself. Flatten annotations into the PNG at natural resolution before send, so the server only ever sees one image. Voice dictation of the description, if you offer it, belongs on both the panel and the annotator.

### Submit and offline resilience

On Send: snapshot the form values, `POST` the bundle to the intake endpoint, optimistically show the success state, reset the form, auto-collapse after ~4s. **If the POST fails, enqueue the bundle to `localStorage` and retry on next app boot** (strip the screenshot from queued entries, keep the last ~10) so a flaky network never loses a report.

Production warning: do **not** send with `fetch(..., { keepalive: true })`. The keepalive body cap is 64KB, so every submit that included a screenshot failed silently until it was removed.

## Part B, Data model

Three tables plus a private storage bucket. SQL is plain Postgres; the RLS blocks are Supabase-specific with a generic note after.

### `bug_reports`, the report

```sql
create table bug_reports (
  id              uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id         uuid references profiles(id) on delete set null,  -- reporter; null = anonymous
  kind            text not null default 'bug' check (kind in ('bug','confusing','idea')),
  expectation     text,                       -- the reporter's words (what they expected)
  route           text,                       -- where it happened (pathname), <=256
  app_version     text,                       -- human version tag, <=40
  app_commit      text,                       -- exact deployed commit SHA (stamped server-side)
  session_id      text,                       -- browser session uuid, <=80
  context         jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,   -- the capture bundle (Part C)
  screenshot_path text,                       -- '{id}/screenshot.png' in the private bucket
  source          text not null default 'user'
                  check (source in ('user','ux-critic','route-crawl','walkthrough')),

  -- triage
  severity        text check (severity in ('low','med','high')),
  summary         text,                       -- admin shorthand, <=280
  reporter_role   text,                       -- reporter's role at filing time (attribution)
  org_id          uuid references organizations(id),  -- reporter's org (was school_id)
  impersonating   boolean,                    -- filed from an admin/demo session?

  -- lifecycle
  status          text not null default 'open' check (status in ('open','triaged','resolved')),
  created_at      timestamptz not null default now(),
  triaged_at      timestamptz,
  resolved_at     timestamptz,
  resolved_by     uuid references auth.users(id) on delete set null,
  resolved_via    text check (resolved_via in ('admin','cli','commit','system')),

  -- resolution
  resolution      text check (resolution in ('fixed','noise','duplicate','wontfix','by_design','acknowledged')),
  fixed_commit    text,                       -- short SHA, kept only for 'fixed'
  duplicate_of    uuid references bug_reports(id) on delete set null,
  reporter_note   text,                       -- warm sentence shown to the reporter, <=600

  -- denormalized thread state (kept current by a trigger on bug_messages)
  last_message_at   timestamptz,
  last_message_role text check (last_message_role in ('reporter','team')),

  -- the constraints that make the model honest:
  constraint resolution_requires_resolved
    check (resolution is null or status = 'resolved'),
  constraint fixed_requires_note
    check (resolution is distinct from 'fixed' or reporter_note is not null),
  constraint no_self_duplicate
    check (duplicate_of is null or duplicate_of <> id)
);

create index bug_reports_created_idx       on bug_reports (created_at desc);
create index bug_reports_user_idx          on bug_reports (user_id, created_at desc);
create index bug_reports_open_idx          on bug_reports (created_at desc) where status = 'open';
create index bug_reports_kind_idx          on bug_reports (kind, created_at desc);
create index bug_reports_status_idx        on bug_reports (status, created_at desc);
create index bug_reports_duplicate_of_idx  on bug_reports (duplicate_of) where duplicate_of is not null;
create index bug_reports_source_idx        on bug_reports (source, created_at desc);
```

On `resolution` values: `fixed` ships a change; `acknowledged` is the honest
close for good ideas you are not building yet (it thanks the reporter without
pretending a fix shipped); `noise` / `wontfix` / `by_design` / `duplicate` are
internal and are never shown to the reporter by name (Part E).

The two constraints worth calling out, because they encode the loop's discipline at the database level:
- **`fixed_requires_note`**, you cannot mark a report `fixed` without a reporter-facing note. This is what guarantees the loop actually closes *to the reporter*, not just internally. The skill and the git hook both honor it; the DB enforces it as a backstop.
- **`resolution_requires_resolved`**, a resolution only exists on a resolved report. No half-states.

### `bug_messages`, the two-way thread

```sql
create table bug_messages (
  id          uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  bug_id      uuid not null references bug_reports(id) on delete cascade,
  sender_role text not null check (sender_role in ('reporter','team')),
  sender_id   uuid references auth.users(id) on delete set null,  -- null for CLI/agent-authored team messages
  body        text not null check (length(btrim(body)) > 0),       -- <=2000 enforced server-side
  created_at  timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index bug_messages_bug_id_created_idx on bug_messages (bug_id, created_at);
```

After-insert trigger keeps the parent's `last_message_at` / `last_message_role` current (denormalized so the inbox can sort/badge without a join):

```sql
create function bug_messages_touch_parent() returns trigger
  language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  update bug_reports
     set last_message_at = new.created_at,
         last_message_role = new.sender_role
   where id = new.bug_id;
  return new;
end $$;
create trigger bug_messages_touch_parent_t
  after insert on bug_messages
  for each row execute function bug_messages_touch_parent();
```

*(Generic equivalent: do this update in your application's "post a message" handler instead of a DB trigger.)*

### `bug_events`, the audit log

Every lifecycle transition is appended here, so the report's history is reconstructable.

```sql
create table bug_events (
  id           uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  bug_id       uuid not null references bug_reports(id) on delete cascade,
  at           timestamptz not null default now(),
  kind         text not null check (kind in ('created','triaged','resolved','reopened')),
  from_status  text,
  to_status    text,
  via          text check (via in ('admin','cli','commit','system','reporter')),
  actor_id     uuid references auth.users(id) on delete set null,  -- null for commit-hook closes
  resolution   text,         -- snapshot at this transition
  fixed_commit text,         -- snapshot
  note         text,         -- snapshot of reporter_note
  metadata     jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb   -- e.g. {severity, summary} on triage
);
create index bug_events_bug_id_at_idx on bug_events (bug_id, at);
```

### Private screenshot bucket

```sql
-- Supabase Storage:
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('feedback', 'feedback', false);
```

Private (never public). One PNG per report at `{report_id}/screenshot.png`. The server (service role) uploads on intake; admins read via short-lived **signed URLs** (~10 to 15 min). *(Generic equivalent: any object store with a private bucket and presigned GET URLs, e.g. S3.)*

A hardening option from production: serve admin screenshots through an endpoint on your own domain (`/admin/bugs/{id}/screenshot`) that re-checks the admin role and proxies the private object, instead of handing out storage-domain signed URLs. Re-check auth **inside** that endpoint; layout-level admin gates often do not run for standalone resource routes.

### Authorization (RLS, Supabase-specific, with the generic rule)

```sql
alter table bug_reports enable row level security;

-- reporter can file (including the anonymous path)
create policy "insert own report" on bug_reports for insert
  with check (user_id = auth.uid() or user_id is null);

-- reporter sees only their own reports
create policy "read own report" on bug_reports for select
  using (user_id = auth.uid());

-- admins see and update everything
create policy "admin read"   on bug_reports for select using (is_global_admin());
create policy "admin update" on bug_reports for update using (is_global_admin());
```

`bug_messages`: reporter can read/insert messages on reports they own (and only as `sender_role = 'reporter'` with `sender_id = auth.uid()`); admins read all. `bug_events`: admin read only. Storage: admins read the `feedback` bucket.

**Generic equivalent (no RLS):** enforce the same rules in your application's data layer: a reporter query is always scoped to `user_id = current_user`; admin endpoints check an admin role; screenshot access goes through a server endpoint that checks admin and returns a presigned URL. The *rules* are the spec; RLS is just one way to enforce them at the database edge.

## Part C, The context bundle (JSON shape)

Stored verbatim in `bug_reports.context`. This is what makes agent-side repro possible.

```jsonc
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "captured_at": "ISO-8601",
  "url": "/path?query",
  "title": "document.title",
  "user_agent": "navigator.userAgent",
  "viewport": { "w": 1440, "h": 900, "dpr": 2 },
  "color_scheme": "dark|light",
  "timezone": "America/Denver",
  "locale": "en-US",
  "scroll": { "x": 0, "y": 1280 },
  "last_element": { "selector": "button.save", "text": "Save" },   // or null
  "perf": {
    "load_ms": 1240, "ttfb_ms": 180, "dom_ms": 600,
    "long_tasks": 3,
    "heap_used_mb": 48, "heap_limit_mb": 2048,
    "connection": { "type": "4g", "downlink": 10, "rtt": 50 }
  },
  "breadcrumbs": [ { "t": 1719440000000, "type": "nav|click|input", "detail": "scrubbed <=160" } ],
  "console":    [ { "t": 1719440000001, "level": "log|info|warn|error", "text": "scrubbed <=300" } ],
  "network":    [ { "t": 1719440000002, "method": "POST", "url": "scrubbed <=300", "status": 500, "ms": 240, "ok": false } ],
  "errors":     [ { "t": 1719440000003, "message": "scrubbed <=300", "stack": "scrubbed <=2000", "source": "file:line:col" } ]
}
```

Every ring is capped (~25 entries) and every string is scrubbed and length-clamped per Part A.

---

## Part D, Backend plumbing

### Intake endpoint, `POST /api/feedback/report`

Receives the bundle and:

1. **Rate-limit** (soft abuse ceiling): if this user filed >= ~6 reports in the last ~2 minutes, silently return `{ ok: true, throttled: true }` (no error shown to the user).
2. **Upload the screenshot** (best-effort, non-blocking): decode the data URL, enforce a hard cap (~6MB), upload to `feedback/{id}/screenshot.png`; on success set `screenshot_path`, on failure set it null and still insert the report.
3. **Stamp server-side metadata** the client must not be trusted to set: the exact deployed commit SHA (from your deploy env var, e.g. `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, first ~12 chars), the reporter's role and org from the server session, and whether the session is an admin impersonation. Attribute `user_id` to the real admin if impersonating.
4. **Insert** the `bug_reports` row (`status = 'open'`).
5. **Log** a `bug_events` row: `kind = 'created'`, `to_status = 'open'`, `via = 'reporter'`.

Returns `{ ok: true, id }`.

### The repair bundle, `buildRepairMarkdown(row)`

A pure function that renders a report row into a readable markdown brief for the agent (the skill reads this plus the raw `context` JSON). Shape:

```
# bug {id8} · {kind}{ · severity}
- status / expected / screen+version / when+session / reporter / agent / viewport / last interaction / scroll / perf
## errors (thrown)       -> message + source + first 6 stack frames
## failed requests       -> method url -> status (ms)
## console               -> level + text
## what they did         -> clock-time breadcrumbs, most recent last
## screenshot            -> saved to feedback/{path} (downloaded alongside as screenshot.png)
```

Keep it a pure function so it powers both the inbox's "copy repair bundle" and the skill's local materialization.

### The single close path, `resolveBug(db, id, input)`

Every close, from the admin UI, the CLI, or the commit hook, goes through one function so the rules and the notification can't be bypassed.

```
input: {
  resolution:   'fixed' | 'noise' | 'duplicate' | 'wontfix' | 'by_design' | 'acknowledged',
  fixedCommit?: short SHA   (kept only when resolution === 'fixed'),
  duplicateOf?: uuid        (kept only when resolution === 'duplicate', not self),
  reporterNote?: string     (<=600; REQUIRED when resolution === 'fixed'),
  resolvedBy?:  admin user id,
  via?:         'admin' | 'cli' | 'commit' | 'system'
}
```

Steps: validate (`fixed` without a note throws), sanitize (clamp the note, drop `fixedCommit`/`duplicateOf` when they don't apply), snapshot the prior status, update the row (`status='resolved'`, resolution fields, `resolved_at/by/via`), append a `bug_events` `resolved` row, then **notify the reporter** (best-effort, non-blocking): title "We fixed something you reported" (for `fixed`) or "We reviewed your feedback", message = the `reporter_note` or a templated default, deep-linked to the reporter's feedback page. If notify fails, log and move on; the resolution already committed.

A matching `reopenBug()` clears the resolution fields and appends a `reopened` event.

### CLI, `bug:resolve`

A thin script over `resolveBug()` for the agent and the hook:

```
bug:resolve <id> [--resolution fixed|noise|duplicate|wontfix|by_design]
                  [--commit <sha>] [--note <text>] [--duplicate-of <id>] [--via commit]
```

Conveniences: default `--resolution fixed`; if `fixed` and no `--commit`, default to `git rev-parse --short HEAD`; accept a short id prefix and resolve it to the one matching report.

---

## Part E, Closing the loop

### The `post-commit` git hook (the keystone)

This is what makes "fix" and "close" a single action. On every commit, the hook scans the message; if it references a bug, it resolves it.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# post-commit, if this commit fixes a reported bug, close it and notify the reporter.
msg=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)
id=$(printf '%s' "$msg" | sed -n 's/.*(bug \([0-9a-f][0-9a-f-]\{5,\}\)).*/\1/p' | head -1)
[ -z "$id" ] && exit 0                                  # not a bug-fixing commit -> no-op

note=$(printf '%s' "$msg"       | sed -n 's/^Bug-Note:[[:space:]]*//p'       | head -1)
resolution=$(printf '%s' "$msg" | sed -n 's/^Bug-Resolution:[[:space:]]*//p' | head -1)

if [ -n "$resolution" ] && [ "$resolution" != "fixed" ]; then
  pnpm bug:resolve "$id" --via commit --resolution "$resolution" ${note:+--note "$note"}
elif [ -n "$note" ]; then
  pnpm bug:resolve "$id" --via commit --note "$note"
else
  echo "WARNING: commit landed but bug $id was NOT closed, a 'fixed' close needs a 'Bug-Note:' trailer."
  echo "         amend it (git commit --amend) or run: pnpm bug:resolve $id --note \"...\""
fi
exit 0   # never fail the commit; it already landed
```

Commit convention the agent follows:

```
fix(parser): handle nested conditions without crashing (bug 43f4d0f6)

Bug-Note: The editor no longer crashes when a rule nests conditions.
Bug-Resolution: fixed
```

Rules: the hook is a no-op on commits without `(bug <id>)`, it never fails the commit, and it warns loudly if a fix lacks the required `Bug-Note:` (the DB also refuses a noteless `fixed`). The executable version ships in this repo at [`githooks/post-commit`](./githooks/post-commit); wire it with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (or copy it into `.git/hooks/`).

### What the reporter sees, the `/feedback` page

The reporter-facing surface lists the user's own reports with **reporter-safe status labels** (never the internal `open/triaged/resolved`): "Submitted", "Reviewing", "Fixed" (or "Reviewed" for any non-fixed close; `noise` and `wontfix` must never leak to the reporter by name). When the team has asked the reporter a question and is waiting, override the label to "Needs your input"; compute that from the thread tip (`last_message_role = 'team'` on an open report). Each report card shows a status timeline, their original words and screenshot, the two-way message thread, and, when fixed, the warm `reporter_note`. The reporter can **reply** in the thread, and **reopen** a report if the fix didn't actually resolve it. A small impact badge ("you've sent N reports, M shipped a fix") makes reporting feel worthwhile. Notifications deep-link here.

---

## Two build profiles: do you need the admin route at all?

Everything before this point is required. The web admin inbox below is not,
and for an AI-native team it is often the wrong first build. Pick a profile:

**Profile A, agent-first (default for teams that triage in Claude Code).**
No `/admin/bugs` route. Triage happens through the bundled
[`triage-bugs`](./skills/triage-bugs/SKILL.md) skill, which reads a window of
reports and renders a local two-pane HTML dashboard: that dashboard is the
inbox read-view. Actions go through the CLIs: `bug:resolve` closes,
`bug:ask` posts the team question, `/fix-bug <id>` is the handoff (no copy
button needed, you are already in the terminal). Screenshots are viewed
locally by the agent; no signed-URL surface ships. You still build everything
the reporter touches: the widget, the intake, the `/feedback` page, the
notifications, and the post-commit hook.

**Profile B, full admin inbox.** Build Part F below as written. Choose this
when non-technical teammates triage, when triage happens on phones, or when
you want the reporter thread answerable from a web surface. Profile A can
grow into Profile B later; the schema and close path are identical.

## Part F, The admin inbox and triage (Profile B)

### Inbox, `/admin/bugs`

Lists reports filtered by status (`open` default, then `triaged`, `resolved`), newest first, with the `source` queue filter from above (*from people* / *from our passes* / *all*, defaulting to people). Each row: a kind icon (bug / confusing / idea), the truncated description (or "({kind}, no note, see context)"), a metadata line (`route · vX · timeago`), and right-side badges (severity, resolution, a camera icon if a screenshot exists). Click through to the detail page.

### Detail and triage, `/admin/bugs/{id}`

Loads the full row, the reporter's profile, a **signed URL** for the screenshot, the message thread, and the rendered repair markdown, and computes the `/fix-bug {id}` command.

Top actions:
- **Open in Claude Code**, copies `/fix-bug {id}` to the clipboard (the handoff to the agent).
- **Copy repair bundle**, copies the markdown + context for local/AI use.
- **Fixed**, opens a form (required `reporter_note`, optional `fixed_commit`) → `resolve` with `resolution='fixed'`.
- **Close as…**, quick buttons for `noise` / `wontfix` / `by_design`, and a `duplicate` (with a canonical id).
- **Reopen**, if resolved, clears the resolution and re-opens.

Triage panel (when `open`): set `severity` (low/med/high) and a `summary`; moves `status: open → triaged`, stamps `triaged_at`, logs a `triaged` event. The page also renders the context as readable widgets: the breadcrumb trail, failed network requests highlighted, console errors, the screenshot, the last-clicked element, and the environment. The **message thread** lets the team ask the reporter a clarifying question (`ask` action posts a `team` message and notifies the reporter "We have a question about your report").

---

## Part G, Building it in your stack

### Supabase-specific vs generic

| Piece | Supabase form | Generic equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Reporter scoping | RLS `using (user_id = auth.uid())` | App-layer: always scope reporter queries to the current user |
| Admin access | RLS `using (is_global_admin())` | App-layer admin-role check on admin endpoints |
| Screenshot storage | private `feedback` bucket + signed URLs | Any object store, private bucket, presigned GET URLs |
| Thread denormalization | after-insert trigger | Update the parent in your "post message" handler |
| Service-role writes | service-role client bypasses RLS for intake/upload/events | A trusted server context / DB role for those writes |
| Realtime (optional) | tables are realtime-capable | Poll, or your own websockets, if you want live inbox updates |
| Deployed commit | `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` | Your platform's build-commit env var |

The behavior, the schema, the constraints, and the loop are the spec. Auth, storage, and realtime are pluggable.

### Build checklist for a coding agent

1. **Schema**, create `bug_reports`, `bug_messages`, `bug_events`, the private screenshot bucket, the two load-bearing CHECK constraints, the indexes, and the thread-denormalization trigger (or its app-layer equivalent). Add authorization (RLS or app-layer) per Part B.
2. **Capture lib**, global ring buffers (console/network/errors/breadcrumbs, cap ~25), the client-side secret scrubber, and `buildContext()`.
3. **Widget**, the docked launcher + panel with the three fields and four states, the screenshot capture (warm on pointerdown, exclude the widget), the keyboard chord, and `submitReport()` with localStorage retry.
4. **Intake endpoint**, rate-limit, screenshot upload, server-stamped metadata, insert, `created` event.
5. **Resolution core**, `buildRepairMarkdown()`, `resolveBug()` (with the `fixed`-needs-a-note rule and the reporter notification), `reopenBug()`, and the `bug:resolve` CLI.
6. **Close-the-loop**, the `post-commit` hook and the commit-trailer convention.
7. **Reporter surface**, the `/feedback` page (safe status labels, thread, reopen, impact badge) and the notification deep-link.
8. **Triage surface**, per your profile: Profile A wires the [`triage-bugs`](./skills/triage-bugs/SKILL.md) skill and the `bug:ask` CLI; Profile B builds the admin inbox (list + detail/triage, signed-URL screenshots, the "Open in Claude Code" handoff, and the resolve/triage/reopen/ask actions).
9. **Wire the agent side**, install the [`fix-bug`](./skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md) skill so `/fix-bug <id>` pulls the row, materializes the repair markdown + context + screenshot, and follows the verify-first procedure before fixing and committing with a `Bug-Note:`.
10. **Prove it**, run [`VERIFY.md`](./VERIFY.md) end to end and show the results.

### How it pairs with the `fix-bug` skill

The widget and schema are the *capture and storage* half; the [`fix-bug`](./skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md) skill is the *fix* half, and the `post-commit` hook is the *closure* that binds them. Build all three and the loop is complete: a user's one-click report becomes a fully-contexted agent task, a verified fix, and an automatic, warm reply back to the person who reported it. That round trip, made cheap, is what turns feedback into a fast product-iteration engine.
